# variables in python

# a way to store data within a program -> it becomes a reference to that data.
# a variable can change
# a = 4 -> variable_name = variable_data

a = 1
b = 2
c = 3.5
hi = "My name is Neha"

print(hi)
print(a)
print(c)
print(a + b)

#Dynamically typed language -> python

#strong typed language -> java, C sharp
# int a = 1;
#
# int b = 2;
#
# float c = 3.5;
#
# string hi = "My name is Neha"

#type () method

print(type(a))
print(type(hi))

# variables can be over-written

# d = 5
# print(d)
# d = 7
# print(d)

# user input
print("What is your name? ")
name = input()
print("Hi")
print(name)
